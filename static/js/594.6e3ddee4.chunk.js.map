Under such circumstances, quark-gluon plasma is formed. It is a phase of matter in which the quarks and gluons are separated (decomposition occurs). Quark-gluon plasma is thought to have been present a few microseconds after the Big Bang, before the quarks and gluons formed protons and neutrons and proceeded to form the universe. ALICE collaboration examines quark-gluon plasma as it cools down, and quarks and gluons begin to confine. The understanding of deconfinement and properties of quark-gluon plasma are important milestones in researching quantum chromodynamics (QCD).\\n' +\n//     '\\n' +\n//     'The detector is located in a cavern 56 metres below ground close to the village of St Genis-Pouilly in France.
